=== compare the type of the varialbale also wehre as == only compare the y

prompt alwys gives us the sring function 

to convert the string to number we use the fucntion parsINT()

ternary opretor 
(codition) ? "ture":"false"

for loop sytnax 
for(satemt -1 , satetment -2, statemnt -3){
    code to run when codition is ture 
}
initally statemnt 1 run for the first time 

for of loop can only be used for iterable objects like sting and arrays 

the main diff brtween the do while is that is excite it self for one time irrpective of the condition ture of false

fucntions 
syntax::
fucntion name (input 1, input 2){


    return value that it give 
}

strings 
.length gives us the lenght of the stings
template literals `${}` in between the braket if u put any varibale then it will automatically take its value 

espcae sequnce
if you want to put the braket or double quotes in betweent the statemt or string 

STINGS METHOODS 
1 - slice
2- replace 
3-contact with this you can join the strings 
3- trim it will remove the unwanted spaces 
4- .inclueds -- is used to cheak weather that it include that specific word or not 

ARRYAS
tostring is used to convert the arrays to string 
.join is used to join the elemetns of the string 
.push is used to add an element to arrya 

delete element is used to delete the element to array but it does not changes it length of it 
.sort() fucntion modify the array 

splice (startnumber , no. of elements to remove , elements u want to add )

slice does not modify the old arrya we need to create the newone 

.fliter and .map fucntion is takes input as the function and if that return teh ture than it will be excuted

CONSOLE METHOODS
assert it take condition if ture than if will give asseriton is ture is false then it will tell show waring of worng 
.table it will turn the  object into the table form which is very handy to use 

.time is used to start the timer 
.timeend will tell when it ended ie you can comapre the time of starting and ending 

BOM AND DOM 
everthing in javasciprt fall under the window object
in bom it is used to redirect the user to another webpage 

location.herf is used to redirect the user to another page

childnode are direct children of html doc

ELEMENTS ONLY NAVIGATION 
firtelemtschild gives us only element where as firstchild gives us all kind of nodes 

matches CLOSEST CONTIANS 
elem.matches is used to cheak if the element mathche the given css selector 
elem.closest serches for the element near it in its parents
elem.contians cheak that the element is inside it in or not if it is then it is true otherwise false 

INNER HTML AND OUTERHTML
inner html is only valid for element nodes  it retunres as string 
outer html also give the tag and its inner html

HIDEEN 
if we add it to calss tag in htmml then it hides that elemetens

ATTRIBUTES METHOODS 
.getAttruties() gives you the attributes 
.hasAttributes(name) gives you ture or false that given attributes is in the element or not
.setAttributee("name", "value") to modify the attributes 
.removeAttributes(name ) to remove teh exitsing atruubites 
.Attributes gives the list of 
if you want ot add your custom attributes the you need to add it like data-xyz and when you want acess then you need to acess it like dataset.xyz where xyz= your custom name 

HTML INSERTATION 
.createelement('div'); will create and div element insted of div you can create and other element 
.appendchild add the childern to it 

elem.remove is used to remove the function
elem.add()to add the things 

CLASS LIST AND CLASSNAME 
we use calssName to changw the class name  
if you wan to change the specific calssthen we use classlist 
.toggle methood will remove if added and we will add if not present 

SET TIME AND SET INTERVAL 
settimeout is used if u want to excute the code after some tim
settimeout(func , duration , arg1 ,arg2 , ... arg n )
set interval us used to excute the js code after some time again again
they both retune timerid in return 
.cleartimeout  is used to clear the timeout that u set or cancell the tiemout 

EVENTS IN JS 
onmousenter = it tell that mouse has enter that region 
removeeventlistner work only when we have same funtion  or same refrence object not diffrent ie it should be predfined 
in add eventlintner while adding the fucntion if u pass the aregument as e in the function then it 
in the e we have client x and client y which gives us the position of the cursor 
element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);


CALLBACKS ASYN AWAIT    
ex syncrous porg is that it runs line line by line  
ex of asyncronus is settimtout fucntion 

.onload is a fucntion which tell when the given task is done 

A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function
This technique allows a function to call another function

A callback function can run after another function has finishe
When you pass a function as an argument, remember not to use parenthesis.
Right: myCalculator(5, 5, myDisplayer);

PROMISE 
it will run in the backgeound and when it will be excuted u will get notififed with the help of .then and .catch
if we are only instreted in error then we will pass first arg as null and then second on as the functin we want ot excute in then methood or direclty we can also use the catch methood to catch the error 

PORMISE METHOODS
.all it will give all the promise when all of them hav excuted 
note if any of the promise fails then you not any pomise in all methood 
.allSettaled will give all values and its status an will not throw an error if any of them fails to excute or to return its value

ASYN AND AWAIT 
if we put async then it will convert that par into pormise 
await tell the javasciprt that wait till it gets teh vlaue ie that your telling javasciprt to wait for that line to excute and then run the other line 
diffrent asysn functino ecxcute parllel

ERROR HANDLING 
try catch only works for syncronous code not for shechdulede code 

FETCH API

JSON.stringfy change the javasciprt object ot string 

COOKIE 
document.cookeie add teh new cookie to js and does not remove the old cookies 
encodeUIcompoent to add speical char to cookie
decodeUIcompoent to deocde those  speical char to cookie

classnaem cnnot have sapces 

//oops 
1- prototypes :
     it is used to add certian proptites to a certina object 
     ex if givne in the sciprt .js'
    
2- static methood 
    it is used to use to function of calss in the calss itslf
